# chattier

Chattier is a simple messaging application. It works with global channels that the user can create, and also you can send direct messages to indivitual users.

Some of the functionalities that I implemented are:

- User authentication and authorization.
- Log out and avatar photo change in settings.
- Add global channels.
- Send messages and photos to channels an direct messages.
- Dark theme.

I used React for the UI and Firebase to use storage, the database, auth and hosting.
You can use it at [https://slack-app-cc624.web.app](https://slack-app-cc624.web.app). Create an account, is really quick. It doesn't ask for comfirmation.
