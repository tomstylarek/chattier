# chattier: A simple chat app

This is a chat application project done with React and Firebase.
You can use it at [https://slack-app-cc624.web.app](https://slack-app-cc624.web.app). Create an account, is really quick. It doesn't ask for comfirmation later.

I implemented user authentication and a bunch of other functionalities, such as sending messages, searching for them, sending photos, adding channels, and more.

The technologies I've used in this project are:

- React (Context, Router, Hooks)
- Firebase (Storage, Database, Hosting)
